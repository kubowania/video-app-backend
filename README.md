# Video-app backend

This project is built as part of a Structured Content tutorial.

To start this project, please sign up to [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/docs/introduction/getting-started?utm_source=readme) first. 

Only once you have signed up to Sanity and created a blank project as per the video instructions, you may proceed. If you do not, the following instructions will not work.

## `npm i` 

Run the command above to install all the packages

## `sanity start`

That will start up the backend in your browser. Make sure to have the `sanity-cli` installed globally.
